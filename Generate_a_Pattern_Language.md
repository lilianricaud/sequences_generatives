# GENERATE A PATTERN LANGUAGE 

Pattern language = list of key centers contributing some essential quality to the system and list of relationships.

Patterns languages cannot be "constructed" and must be generated by a differentiating step by step process.

Patterns language can be generated by this step by step sequence. 


## WHOLENESS OBSERVATION/PERCEPTION
Observe and feel the wholeness of system. Particular important to feel the latent centers "what wants to emerge ?"

## CREATIVE MOOD SETTING
Get people in a mood governed by feeling not reason/head
Create a space/time so people can share their dreams.

## STORY COLLECTION
Collect stories to get a verbal picture
this is poetic vision, not a sociological survey

## PATTERN LANGUAGE SKETCH 
intuitive amalgation of people's dream to build a draft pattern language
list of patterns = essential elements
draft will be refined by further discussions

## LANGUAGE COMPLETENESS
Use the 7 principes below to create a complete pattern language

### 1 RELATIONSHIPS
defines possible configurations the languuage generates

### 2 (SPATIAL) ENTITIES
langauge containe or defines several entities, the relationships are defined among these entities.

### 3 RELIABILITY
relationships are reliable and true, not arbitrary

### 4 CONSISTENCY
Consistency between patterns to generate real physical configurations

### 5 INCONSISTENCY
sometimes refreshing and life giving, generates vigor and opens new ideas (PROBLEM IS THE SOLUTION)

### 6 COMPLETENESS
System of patterns is complete if it contains sufficient relationships to allow well formed configuration to be built.

### 7 COHERENCE
The relationships among patterns tend most of the time to generate easily graspable geometrical configurations.


# GENERATIVE SEQUENCE GENERATION

Note that the pattern language itself is a tool to plan and predict where to go but it doesn't tell the system's builder where to start. Together with 15 geometrical properties defined by Alexander, it can only be used as tool to validate good choice were made a posteriori


## GENERATIVE SEQUENCE
Ideally the geometrical configuration can be constructed by following certain sequential procedure that will always lead to a coherent configuration in a small number of steps. Generative sequence itself cannot be "constructed" and must be generated.

## ITERATIVE STEPS
Work step by step to reduce the number of variables you have to deal with for decision at any step. Steps allow for evaluation times.

## EVALUATION

At each step evaluate the result. Does it add new centers ? Does it increase the strenght of the centers ? Check against your pattern language and the 15 geometrical properties. 
Check for mistakes
mistake (error) = miss + take = forgot to take something into account.

If there is smething you missed go back to previous step.

## NO IMAGES
Avoid the use of images and draing and instead work with prototypes and mock ups so that people are not trapped in the details of the image but rather in the mainframe at each steps.
