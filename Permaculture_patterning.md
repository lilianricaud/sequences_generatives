## Permaculture_patterning

Both permaculture and pattern design are conscious approach to design living systems.

### Permaculture design: 
Start with elements (parts)
assemble them
into a whole

This is a process of starting with parts then creating wholes by addition.

### Patterning (Alexander)

start with a whole ...
differentiate it ...
into parts ...

This is a process of starting with wholes then creating parts by differentiation.

### Start with mainframe

Roads, water structure, 

### Analysis

### Permaculture Criteria for connections

“Highest use tells us how to connect design elements or activities in time by linking their functions or uses in a sequence. It tells us what to do first.”

“Needs and resources analysis tells us how to connect the parts of a design to one another.”

“The zone system organizes the parts of the design in relation to the user or center of use.”

“Sector analysis organizes design elements into useful relationships with outside influences that we cannot directly affect.”
