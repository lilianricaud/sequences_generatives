## Permaculture_patterning

Both permaculture and pattern design are conscious approach to design living systems.

### Permaculture design: 
Start with elements (parts)
assemble them
into a whole

This is a process of starting with parts then creating wholes by addition.

### Patterning (Alexander)

start with a whole ...
differentiate it ...
into parts ...

This is a process of starting with wholes then creating parts by differentiation.

### Start with mainframe

Roads, water structure, 

### Analysis

### Permaculture Criteria for connections

“Highest use tells us how to connect design elements or activities in time by linking their functions or uses in a sequence. It tells us what to do first.”

“Needs and resources analysis tells us how to connect the parts of a design to one another.”

“The zone system organizes the parts of the design in relation to the user or center of use.”

“Sector analysis organizes design elements into useful relationships with outside influences that we cannot directly affect.”

- First get the big picture patterns in context – starting from bioregion and neighbourhood (geo-physical & social patterns, I’ve developed my own ESM tool for this), and 
- clarify the strategic plan (vision, aims, objective, values). 
- Then the patterning more immediate external influences (sector analysis) and mapping the patterns within the site itself (site analysis). Here I find Ian McHarg’s exclusion overlay process particularly useful as a tool for mapping the ‘higher order’ ecological needs of the site (I call this “listening to the land”) plus other restraints (buffer zones, legislative, planning), which then provides a context to move into conceptual bubble planning, functional analysis, flow patterns & analysis, which lead into spacial patterns and relationship between systems (zonation), 
- then last, but not least the placement and patterning of the individual elements as the design details. 
- Assembling or patterning the relationship of the elements always come last and within the context of the big-picture patterns.


## Darren Doherty sequence for plans making

### 1) Google Earth

Google Earth photo data is getting better all of the time and it is a blessing to have it available. We use Google Earth Pro, NearMap & other services to obtain high quality images and then use ‘Grab’ or similar apps to take higher resolution screen shots and then use Photoshop’s ‘Photomerge‘ tools to assemble a very high quality mosaic as we have done in this case, making sure that each ‘Grab’ has sufficient overlap to allow the photo merge possible

### 2) The Cadastral Layer

The cadastral layer identifies the legal title boundaries which is important to know, particularly if the client has it in their mind to subdivide the property in future and will want the landscape plan to reflect that potential.

### 3) Topographic Map

A topographic map is necessary for us to analyse the landform and help us develop plans that ‘bring water under control‘ (P.A. Yeomans) as when we do that we can develop reliable and profitable agricultural ecologies. Ideally we would have 0.5-1.0m contour maps however they are not always available due to their relatively high cost to the farmer (AUD$8+/hectare).

### 4) Water Storage

After calculating the number of livestock that will be able to be sustained (including projected improvements in carrying capacity) on this parcel we then work out how much water is needed in storage, making allowances for unreliable rain and dry years that are a regular feature of South Eastern Australia. With the advent of plastic pipe we are able to deliver water very efficiently by gravity after a windmill pumps water to an elevated header tank. Today’s powerful bulldozers with hydraulic rippers and tilting hydraulic blades can build deep dams (4-6m+) with a minimum of surface area thereby reducing evaporation considerably over shallow dams with large surface areas. 1:1 internal batters are also feasible largely because livestock are fenced out as they get their water from portable troughs fed by the gravity-fed pipe network.

### 5) Water Harvesting

After siting dams high in the landscape we usually need to increase their catchment. This provides for increased storage reliability which is of course critical to the success of an enterprise that needs water for livestock and other purposes. Consideration of reduced runoff due to improved land management practices (increasing the water cycle) also comes into play and further increases the need for catchment devices. These 1:400 gradient drains will harvest overland flow from summer storms when the ground is naturally dry and harder and in autumn-spring when field capacity is reached.

### 6) Calculating Catchment

Its important as part of the process of scoping out water harvesting & storage projects to ensure that what you think will work will actually work. That’s why Regrarians applies a 5 step process of due diligence before building any dam, including catchment analysis to determine the volumes of run off available to a proposed site.


### 7) Irrigation

Irrigation reticulation pipe is best laid on ridges to allow for maximum coverage of foothills landscapes. Other elements such as farm roads, trees and fencing then follow these water lines as conduits of flow & subdivision. This pattern ensures that you always know where the pipes are and always will even if the land changes hands!


### 8) Access

Access is critical on any property and especially where multiple visits are required to livestock or other farm systems. Keyline water planning determines the placement of roads to follow that of water systems, in this case the piped reticulation system. Like water pipe, farm roads should ideally be central to service as much land as possible, be in a loop and be on the apex of ridges to reduce slope, erosion, earthworks and permit maximum vision to the landscape under management.

### 9) Headlands

Headlands are necessary for any project layout to provide for vehicle turning be it a wheel barrow or 30′ header! Keyline cultivation patterns are also the guide for the placement of parallel rows of trees in either wide spacing (eg. 60m x 60m ‘Grassy Woodland/Dehesa) or contiguous rows or belts.

### 10) Forestry

Various forestry systems are integrated in with the headlands offsets & Keyline guidelines restricting the extent of these systems. Placement of respective systems is determined by the distance from the yards along with solar access, wind direction and client discussions.
